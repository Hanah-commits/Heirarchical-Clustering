## Heirarchial Clustering

Python implementation of Heirarchial Clustering on methylation data of adult stem cell differentiation in mouse.

Methylation data: https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(12)00544-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1097276512005448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue


The linkage criterion uses the Euclidean distance to determine the distance between the methylation levels of two cell types.

Output in each iteration: The cell types that are merged, their linkage value, the current cluster assignment


Run the program with:

```python3 Clustering.py```
